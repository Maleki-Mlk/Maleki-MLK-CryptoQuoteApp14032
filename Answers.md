# Answers to Technical Questions
##1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? 
I spent approximately **4 hours** on the coding assignment

1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment?
2. If I had more time, I would add:
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API calls to manage unexpected responses or downtime.
- **Caching**: Introduce caching mechanisms to store frequently requested cryptocurrency data to reduce API calls and improve response times.
- **Unit Tests**: While I have included basic unit tests, I would expand the test coverage to include edge cases and performance tests.
- **Documentation**: Improve code documentation and comments for better clarity and maintainability.

## 2. Most Useful Feature in Latest Version of C#
One of the most useful features added in the latest version of C# (C# 10) is **global using directives**. This allows for cleaner code by eliminating repetitive using statements in each file.

### Code Snippet
```csharp
// In a file called GlobalUsings.cs
global using System.Net.Http;
global using Newtonsoft.Json;

// Now you can use these namespaces in any file without repeating the using statement.

Tracking Down a Performance Issue in Production
To track down a performance issue in production, I would:

Use Profiling Tools: Employ application performance monitoring (APM) tools like New Relic or Application Insights to identify bottlenecks.
Analyze Logs: Review logs for error patterns or slow responses.
Load Testing: Simulate high-load scenarios in a staging environment to replicate the issue.
Database Queries: Examine slow-running database queries that could be causing delays.

 Latest Technical Book or Conference
The latest technical book I read is "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship" by Robert C. Martin.
 I learned the importance of writing readable and maintainable code, 
which includes principles such as meaningful naming, proper function size, and refactoring.

I found the technical assessment to be well-structured and relevant. 
It effectively tested not only coding skills but also problem-solving abilities
 and understanding of software design principles. It allowed me to demonstrate
 my proficiency in using APIs, handling data, and implementing best practices.
